As a Linux Systems Engineer working at Acumera, my role is multifaceted, encompassing various responsibilities to ensure the efficient operation of our infrastructure. 
</p>

<p>
Key aspects of my position include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Infrastructure Deployment
<pre>
Proficiently utilizing Puppet to build out new equipment and virtual machines (VMs) 
for customers. This involves configuring and optimizing Linux systems to meet 
specific requirements.
</pre>

<li>
Cloud Infrastructure Management
<pre>
Setting up new Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in AWS to facilitate the seamless 
rollout of customer VMs. This involves configuring networking, security, and 
other AWS services to create robust and scalable environments.
</pre>

<li>
Automation Scripting
<pre>
Developing scripts to automate intricate tasks, enhancing operational efficiency. 
These scripts empower our customer support team to address and resolve issues 
promptly, ensuring a swift and effective response to customer needs.
</pre>

<li>
Escalation Handling
<pre>
Handling escalations from customers when their infrastructure encounters issues. 
This involves diagnosing and resolving complex problems, collaborating with 
cross-functional teams to ensure the restoration of normal operations.
</pre>

<li>
Jenkins Integration
<pre>
Collaborating with Jenkins to design automated buildout jobs. This process 
streamlines the provisioning of customer equipment from a gold-image, reducing 
manual intervention and enhancing the speed and consistency of our 
deployment processes.
</pre>

</ul>
<p>
In summary, my role involves a combination of infrastructure deployment, cloud management, automation scripting, escalation handling, and Jenkins integration, contributing to the overall reliability and efficiency of our systems and services.
