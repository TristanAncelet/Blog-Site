I have an DIY Ubuntu NAS (one of the first few linux installs), and I was having aggravations with the zfs-dkms package that I had setup a couple of years ago to host raided pools for my NAS setup. However, recently during an update I noticed the kernel was updated on the machine to 6.2.0-39-generic which now caused the zfs-dkms to throw errors when apt would run mkinitcpio as the zfs-dkms-2.1.5 module only supported up to kernel 5.19.
</p>

<p>
While it didn't exactly cause any issues with the zfs installation there was currently (it still functioned fine even with the new kernel). I got tired of it so I decided to compile openzfs from source and install it on my system.
</p>

<pre bash>
## Run as root
# sudo -i 

git clone https://github.com/openzfs/zfs

## I was missing a few dependencies but installed them like so
apt install uuid-dev libblkid-dev

cd zfs
## Run the autoconf autogen script
./autogen.sh
## Run the configure script to build the Makefile
./configure

## Build the module to make sure everything goes ok
make 

## Had to add the extra modules to the depmod search ath
depmod_cont="$(&lt;/etc/depmod.d/ubuntu.conf)"
## Replace "search" with "search extra" to put the extra modules into the depmod path
depmod_cont="${depmod_cont/search/search extra}"
echo "$depmod_cont" &gt; /etc/depmod.d/ubuntu.conf

## Build and intall
make install

## Run ldconfig
ldconfig

## Run depmod
depmod
</pre>

Upon finishing installation and reboot I noticed that when the server rebooted it didn't mount the pools on boot. I always had to import them manually <code>zpool import data &amp;&amp; zpool import media</code>
</p>

<p>
I was confused because the configs setup by my dkms installation were still valid <code>/etc/defaults/zfs</code>.
</p>

<p>
While it took me an hour to figure it out, I eventually figured out what was wrong and why zfs wasn't importing my pools.
</p>

<p>
the services configured in /usr/lib/systemd/system were setup with the path that bsd/unix would use for the zpool.cache file (<code>/usr/local/etc/zfs/zpool.cache</code>) instead of what zfs was configured with on my zfs-dkms installation (<code>/etc/zfs/zpool.cache</code>).

<p>
All I ended up needing to do was change the path's that the service files from <code>/usr/local/etc/zfs/zpool.cache</code> to <code>/etc/zfs/zpool.cache</code> (wherever applicable).
</p>

<p>
After doing that and rebooting the pools were imported and mounted as they previously had.
